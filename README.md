# Wastewater-Based Epidemiology Dashboard
This repository contains code for building a dashboard for displaying wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) data including time-series and spatial results. The examples here are allow users to create their own dashboard using the same code with options to modify for any pathogen of interest. Results can be displayed in time-series plots showing quantifiable detections, detect/non-detects only, and maps showing recent trends.

## Repo description
This repo contains one R script that is an R `shiny` app. You  can download and run the app locally once you install the packages. No outside data are needed to run the app code.

## Web version of example dashboard
You can view a live version of this testing dashboard at the following link: [https://nywastewatcher.shinyapps.io/wbe-dashboard-example/](https://nywastewatcher.shinyapps.io/wbe-dashboard-example/). This is a free and open source link. Please remember to close your browser once you have finished viewing the example dashbaord.
